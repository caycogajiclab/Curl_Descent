This repository contains the code needed to generate and analyse the data for reproducing the figures of the paper. An additional folder 'Eigval_distrib_theory_vs_empirical' contains a notebook for comparing the empirical distributions of the random matrices of interest in our analytical derivations with theoretical distributions predicted by using elements from random matrix theory.
